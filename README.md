This script was written for those who get stuck into things and lose track of time

Once the timer is set and it reaches the agreed upon time, a youtube clip of Adam Sandler yelling at a golf ball telling it to
go home will automatically open and play, interrupting whatever you are doing.

Once the link has been opened the script will ask if you are leaving, input y or n
y = end script (window will close
n = restart script
